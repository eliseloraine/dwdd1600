        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><b>Life is quite simple.</b> As people, we often overcomplicate things & become overwhelmed by the world around us. Growing up, my family & I moved around a lot, which provided me with the opportunity of living coast to coast & nearly everywhere in between. Because of this, <i>I know the impact a home can make.</i> I am firm believer that this thing we call <b>life is nothing more than a collection millions of little moments, many of which take place under the roofs of our very own homes.</b> I know as I reflect on my own life, I often picture the various homes I grew up in and the people who were there with me. I have a desire to create spaces for others where those memories can take place and will last a life time.</p>
