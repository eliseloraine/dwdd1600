    <!-- <h2>The Importance of Architectual Details</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Enhances the Foundation of the Space:</b> Architectural details such as moldings, trim, and built-in features establish a refined framework, adding depth and dimension. These elements create a polished foundation that elevates the design and enhances the room’s character.</li>
        <li><b>Defines the Room’s Style and Aesthetic:</b> Thoughtfully selected architectural details serve as a visual language that reflects the space's intended style—whether modern, traditional, or minimalist. They contribute to the overall aesthetic, ensuring each room feels cohesive and tailored.</li>
        <li><b>Improves Functionality and Flow:</b> Well-planned architectural details, like custom cabinetry or integrated lighting, blend beauty with function. They support the space's practical needs while guiding the flow and making everyday interactions within the space more intuitive and enjoyable.</li>
    </ul> -->

    <h2>My Story:</h2> 
        <p>Life is quite simple and as people we often overcomplicate things and become overwhelmed by the world around us. Growing up, my family moved around a lot, by the time I was in college I’d lived in seven different states, each one shaping me in ways I didn’t yet understand. Every new city, new house, and new routine felt like a mini chapter in my life. And as we unpacked the same boxes over and over, I discovered that I was finding myself through these homes and the unique “heartbeat” each one held. While moving from state to state, I quickly learned at a young age that “home” was more than an address - it was a feeling, a collection of little details that made each space unique.</p>
        <br><br><p>Each of these houses hold my family, our stories, and even my own growth. The house in Colorado with my first play set in the backyard, where I scraped my knee learning to ride a bike. The rental house in Texas, where I had my first kiss and eventually met my best friend, who would later stand by my side as I married the love of my life. The apartment in Pennsylvania with the white wooden exterior, where I learned that slowing down could be part of my everyday life. In each place, the rooms, walls, and hidden corners carried pieces of our journey, encapsulating the laughter, occasional chaos, and all the “firsts” that helped me grow.</p>

        <p>With each move, I found that these spaces were more than just “temporary” - they were pieces of our evolving identity. While I might not remember all the furniture we had or the exact shade of paint on the walls, I do remember the way those spaces made us feel, how they gave us comfort and stability, even when everything else seemed uncertain. This realization is what led me to a career in interior design: I want to create spaces that are more than just aesthetically pleasing. I want to help people create places that truly feel like home.</p>
        <br><br><p>In my work, I am constantly searching for the balance between beauty and meaning. Sure, a well-designed room is important, but it’s even more important that it feels right. I want to help clients walk into their space and immediately feel like themselves - no facades, no pretenses. Just the simple feeling that, here, in this space, they belong. Because when the world outside is chaotic, having a home that reflects who you are at your core can feel like a lifeline.</p>
        <br><br><p>This philosophy is rooted in the belief that life is made up of tiny moments - millions of them - many of which take place under the roofs of our very own homes. A favorite coffee mug sitting on a kitchen counter, the morning sunlight filtering through sheer curtains, the familiar creak of a wooden floor. Home is the setting for all those moments, the big and the small, the ordinary and the unforgettable. My goal with every project is to give clients a canvas where their lives can unfold.
