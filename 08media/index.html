        <h1>Life is quite simple...</h1>
        <p>As people, we often overcomplicate things &amp; become overwhelmed by the world around us. Growing up, my family &amp; I moved around a lot, which provided me with the opportunity of living coast to coast &amp; nearly everywhere in between. Because of this, <em>I know the impact a home can make.</em> I am firm believer that this thing we call <b>life is nothing more than a collection millions of little moments, many of which take place under the roofs of our very own homes.</b> I know as I reflect on my own life, I often picture the various homes I grew up in and the people who were there with me. I have a desire to create spaces for others where those memories can take place and will last a life time.</p>
